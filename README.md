# Tarantula Sellers

A small Java Swing application that simulates a storefront for purchasing different categories of tarantulas. Users can browse tarantula types (arboreal, terrestrial, fossorial), view their prices, and add items to a shopping cart.

## Features
- **Multiple Tarantula Categories**  
  Includes arboreal, terrestrial, and fossorial tarantulas, each with its own list of names and prices.
  
- **GUI Pages**  
  Four main pages:
  1. **Home Page:** Introduction to the store  
  2. **Cart Page:** Displays items the user has selected  
  3. **Arboreal/Terrestrial/Fossorial Pages:** Category-specific pages where users can add tarantulas to their cart

- **Dynamic Selection**  
  The application uses arrays to store tarantula names and prices, making it easy to adjust data.

- **Shopping Cart**  
  An in-app cart tracks selected tarantulas and calculates a running total.
